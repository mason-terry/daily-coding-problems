/*
this problem was asked by dropbox.

a boolean formula can be said to be satisfiable if there is a way to assign truth values to each variable such that the entire formula evaluates to true.

for example, suppose we have the following formula, where the symbol ¬ is used to denote negation:

(¬c or b) and (b or c) and (¬b or c) and (¬c or ¬a)

one way to satisfy this formula would be to let a = false, b = true, and c = true.

this type of formula, with and statements joining tuples containing exactly one or, is known as 2-cnf.

given a 2-cnf formula, find a way to assign truth values to satisfy it, or return false if this is impossible.
